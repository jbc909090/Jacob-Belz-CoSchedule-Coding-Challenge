# Jacob-Belz-CoSchedule-Coding-Challenge
For CoSchedule

This uses a backend made in Java Spring and a frontend made in Angular

To run, start up the backend. I use the community edition of the IntelliJ to run the backend application (CodingChallengeApplication.java)
Then in VSCode I go to the directory for coding-challenge-frontend and run ng serve, follow the link to localhost:4200 and use the program like a website.

You will need to configure the file ".env.properties" found in the resources folder of the backend to connect to a local postgres database on your own computer, it is currently configured for my own local database/no database.

the Giphy API key is hardcoded into the code so it should connect.
